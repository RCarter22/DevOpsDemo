If during the Warranty period the Software does not substantially perform in accordance with the functional specs, InterPro, shall, at the Customer’s option correct or replace the Software free of additional charge. Any replacement Software shall be warranted for ninety (90) days or the remainder of the Warranty Period; whichever is longer.

If InterPro is unable to supply Customer with media that is free from defects in materials or workmanship, such that the Software cannot perform substantially in accordance with the functional specs, then InterPro shall refund Customer all fees or charges paid for the License and the ASMP.  

4.3 Software.  InterPro warrants that their software has been reviewed for security flaws, by an independent organization that specializes in application security and does not contain any security flaws. InterPro shall cause to be conducted, prior to delivery to Customer of any new major release, a revalidation of the software for security flaws.  InterPro warrants that the Software shall be free from all computer viruses, worms, back doors, disabling devices and other harmful or malicious code intended to or which may damage, disrupt, inconvenience or permit access to the Software user's or another's software, hardware, networks, data or information.

4.4 Sole remedy. The remedies contained in sub-clauses 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above are the Customer’s sole remedies for breach of warranty. The parties agree that the provisions of this clause 4 of the Agreement allocate the risks between InterPro and Customer and Customer explicitly agrees that InterPro’s pricing reflects this allocation of risk and the limitations of liability.


5.	Intellectual Property

5.1	Ownership. Subject only to the License expressly granted in Section 2 hereof, InterPro and its licensors own and shall retain all right, title and interest, including all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, moral rights and all intellectual or industrial property rights of every kind and description, in and to (i) the Software and documentation, (ii) any and all corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates, service patches and all new versions (major and minor) provided by InterPro to Customer under this Agreement; and (iii) all developments, inventions, works of authorship, ideas, trade secrets, documents, software, data, information and all tangible and intangible property contained or embodied in the Software or the documentation, or otherwise licensed or delivered hereunder, and all derivatives of any of the foregoing (i), (ii) or (iii). Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Software constitutes a valuable trade secret and asset of InterPro. 

5.2	Indemnification. InterPro shall at its own expense, indemnify, defend, and hold Customer harmless from and against any legal claim or proceeding that the Software infringes any US patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary right of any third party, provided that Customer has given written notice of any claim, action, or allegation of infringement to InterPro within thirty (30) days after Customer first receives written notice thereof. InterPro shall have exclusive right to defend any such claim, action, or allegation and make settlements thereof at its own discretion. InterPro will not be responsible or indemnify Customer for any settlement or compromise made without InterPro’s prior written consent. Customer shall give such assistance and information as InterPro may reasonably require in settling or opposing such claims. If any such infringements occurs or in InterPro’s opinion may occur, InterPro may, at its sole option and expense: 

5.2.1     procure for Customer the right to continue use of the Software;

5.2.2.    modify or amend the Software, or replace the Software with other software having similar capabilities; or

5.2.3    if the above options are not in InterPro’s sole opinion reasonably commercially possible, InterPro may request that the Customer return the infringing Software to InterPro along with a written notice of termination of the Master Agreement and the License Agreement, and upon receipt of the infringing Software, InterPro shall repay to Customer an amount equal to the License Fee paid for the for the applicable year. InterPro and Customer will then be released from any further obligations to the other under this Agreement except for the obligations of indemnification provided for above and such other obligations that survive termination.

5.3 Exclusions. InterPro will not be liable to Customer under the terms of the above clause 5.2 or otherwise if any infringement or claim thereof is based upon (i) the use of the Software in violation of this Agreement, or (ii) use of a superseded or altered release of the Software if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Software otherwise available to Customer. The foregoing states the entire liability of InterPro and the entire and exclusive remedy of the Customer with respect to infringement of a patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary right.



6.	Copying and reverse engineering

6.1	Copies. Customer may make copies of the software, as reasonably required for backup, disaster recovery or archival purposes. Such copies may not be used in a production environment and Customer agrees to reproduce trademarks, logos and proprietary notice from the original copy. 

6.2	No reverse engineering. Customer may not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to generate the source code of the Software. 


7.	Termination


7.1	Termination by Customer. Customer may terminate this License effective immediately upon receipt of prior written notice to InterPro.

7.2	Termination by InterPro. InterPro may terminate this License immediately upon written notice to Customer if: (i) Customer fails to comply with any term or condition of this License and such non-compliance is not corrected to InterPro’s satisfaction within thirty (30) days after written notice of the non-compliance is given by InterPro to Customer; 

7.3	Consequences of Termination. If this License is terminated for any reason, Customer shall erase or destroy the original and all copies of the Software and certify in writing that the original and all copies have been erased or destroyed. All License Fees due to InterPro shall become immediately due and payable without further notice. Those clauses of this License which by their nature should survive will survive. 


8.	Limitation of Liability

This is as stated in sub-clause 6 of the Agreement.


9.	Assignment

Customer may not assign or sub-license its rights under this License without InterPro’s prior written consent.


10.	Source Code Escrow.
  
10.1	At the request of the Customer, INTERPRO shall place a copy of the Source Code for all Works in escrow with a third party escrow agent chosen by the Customer, with Customer as a named beneficiary.  All costs associated with maintaining the Source Code in escrow will be paid by Customer.  The parties agree that any escrow agreement shall provide Customer with the right to have the escrow agent verify the deposit materials.  If, during the Term of the Agreement, any of the following events occur, INTERPRO agrees to cause such third party escrow agent to furnish to Customer, upon request and without charge, a single copy of the Source Code for the current version of the Works then in use by Customer:

	(a)	INTERPRO dissolves its business or otherwise ceases to do business in the ordinary course (other than a cessation of business due to a sale of INTERPRO or its business, or any other transaction where the maintenance and development of the Works is carried on by a successor), or 
	(b)	INTERPRO files for bankruptcy under any state or federal bankruptcy law, whether or not such filing is for the purpose of dissolution or reorganization provided that such action is not dismissed or terminated within 60 days of the filing,  or
	(c)	INTERPRO ceases to engage in active maintenance and development of the software licensed hereunder; or
	(d)	InterPro fails to resolve, or to provide an acceptable workaround for any material Maintenance and Support issue identified by Customer in accordance with the Agreement within 120 days of notification of such material issue by Customer.

10.2	Upon taking possession of the Source Code, Customer may use the Source Code only to (a) perform INTERPRO’s development or maintenance obligations with respect to the correction of errors  in order to ensure that the software operates in accordance with its specified documentation; and (b) in the event any of the circumstances described in 10.1 (a), (b) or (c) above occur, to produce derivative works intended solely for Customer’s internal business purposes and not for the purpose of sale or marketing to third parties.

10.3	The terms of the software license set forth herein shall apply to any use of the Source Code released pursuant to the software escrow except as expressly described in this section.  A release of the Source Code authorizes Customer to use the Source Code in the ordinary course of business.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Source Code at all times shall remain INTERPRO’s Confidential Information; and in no event does Release of the Source Code authorize Customer to distribute the source code to any third party.   INTERPRO acknowledges that if, as a debtor in possession or a trustee in bankruptcy under the federal Bankruptcy Code, it rejects this Agreement or the escrow agreement that Customer may elect to retain its rights under Section 365(n) of such Bankruptcy Code.   


11.	Miscellaneous

This License will be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts. Customer consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Courts in any action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.
